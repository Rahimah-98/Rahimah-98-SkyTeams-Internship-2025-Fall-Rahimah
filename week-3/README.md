## SkyTeams Internship 2025 Fall —— Week-3: Algorithms, Patterns & Problem-Solving

## Topics That I Learned:

- String and number manipulation
- Prime logic, palindrome checks, Armstrong numbers
- Array operations: search, unique elements, equality, duplicate removal
- Mathematical algorithms: Pascal’s Triangle, Collatz sequence, binary conversion
- Pattern generation with nested loops
- Recursion concepts (factorial)
- Strengthening problem-solving and debugging skills

## Reflections

This week focused on enhancing my problem-solving skills through string, number, and array manipulation. Completing these challenges improved my algorithmic thinking, and ability to write clean, efficient, and structured JavaScript code.
