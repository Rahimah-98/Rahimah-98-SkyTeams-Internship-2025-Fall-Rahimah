# SkyTeams Internship 2025 Fall – Rahimah Ansari

## Overview

This repository contains all my programming exercises and solutions for the SkyTeams Internship 2025 Fall.  
Each week has its own folder with solutions file.

Each week folder contains:

- Solution files for each question
- Corresponding test files
- A weekly README.md summarizing my learning

  ## Week 1 – Fundamentals, Testing, and GitHub Basics

  **Topics Covered:**

  - Variables, Data Types, Loops, Conditionals, Functions
  - Arrays, Objects, Clean Code

  - Basic testing principles (unit tests for functions)

  **Exercises:**

  1. Swap the values of two variables
  2. Check if a number is even, odd, or prime
  3. Sum all numbers in an array
  4. Write a function to reverse a string/list
  5. Find the largest number in a list or collection
  6. Refactor messy code into readable functions

  ## Week 2 – Programming Basics

  This week covers essential programming exercises focused on variables, conditions, loops, and basic algorithms. Each task includes a description and example input/output.

  **Exercises:**

  1. Swap two variables (no temp variable)
  2. Largest & smallest of three numbers

  20. Count digits
  21. Sum of digits
  22. Even numbers in a range
  23. Fibonacci series
  24. GCD of two numbers
  25. LCM of two numbers

  **Each task includes a description, input, and expected output.**

  ## Week 3 – JavaScript Logic & Problem-Solving Challenges

  This week focus on strengthening core programming logic through 30 hands-on challenges covering: strings, numbers, arrays, loops, recursion, and pattern generation. By solving problems like prime checking, factorials, Pascal’s triangle, array operations, and binary conversion, I improved my algorithmic thinking, debugging skills, and ability to write clear, efficient JavaScript code.

  **Exercises:**

  1. Count vowels in a String
  2. Reverse a number
  3. Sum of digits of a number
  4. Display all factors of a number
  5. Find the largest element in an array
  6. Find the smallest element in an array
  7. Sum of all elements in an array
  8. Check if an array contains a specific element
  9. Count occurrences of an element in an array
  10. Check whether a number is prime
  11. Generate all prime numbers up to N
  12. Check for palindrome number
  13. Power of a number (without built-in function)
  14. Find factorial of a number
  15. Check for Armstrong number
  16. Fibonacci sequence
  17. Pattern printing – Right-angled triangle
  18. Pattern printing – Right-aligned triangle
  19. Pattern printing – Pyramid
  20. Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator
  21. Password strength checker
  22. Collatz sequence
  23. Factorial using recursion
  24. Pascal’s Triangle
  25. Number guessing game
  26. Convert decimal to binary
  27. Find unique elements in an array
  28. Remove duplicates from an array
  29. Check if two arrays are equal
  30. Find missing number in array (1 to N)
