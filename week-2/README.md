## SkyTeams Internship 2025 Fall —— Week-2: Programming Basics

## Topics That I Learned:

- Swapping variables without a temporary variable.

- Conditional statements (if-else, switch-case) for checking largest/smallest numbers, even/odd, positive/negative, grade calculation, leap year, character types, and triangle validity.

- Loops for printing sequences, calculating sums, generating multiplication tables, and Fibonacci series.

- Arithmetic operations for area & perimeter calculation, temperature conversion, simple & compound interest, GCD, and LCM.

- Converting seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.

- Using switch-case statements to implement a simple calculator, traffic light system, and month name & days display.

## Reflections

This week helped me strengthen my understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as: loops, conditionals, arithmetic operations, and functions. It also improved my problem-solving using JavaScript.
